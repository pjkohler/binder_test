# binder_test

This is just an empty repo that is used for testing jupyter notebook code with binder, where the environment is defined in this repo:

https://github.com/pjkohler/binder_main

A binder hub link can then be generated here: https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link

where binder_main is the environment repo and binder_test (this repo) is the content repo. 

Of course, any other repo can also be used as the content repo.
